      <h3>Kabir Ahammad</h3>
      <p> As my aim is to be an efficient programmer, I started this journey to study at a university after coming to the UK in 2017. Firstly, I had been enrolled in ESOL Entry-2 at Newham College of Further Education, East London. Periodically, I  completed ESOL Entry-3, ESOL Level-1, Level-2, Functional Skill English. This year, I have achieved Access to HE Diploma in Electronics with software Engineering certificate and GCSH Math certificate with grade-8.

        Programming languages are what I always want to be skilled in. That is why I was seeking a platform where I can achieve my goal.
        After two weeks of Coding Bootcamp at City University, I realised that my dream is going to be fulfilled. I found all the lecturers of my department in the city are talented and experienced. If I follow their guidelines properly, I could achive an excellent result. Now my confidence has become stronger about programing.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Solar System</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project on Processing, concluding the 2-week Programming Bootcamp at City 2021. This project has been created on Processing which is my very first time experience. 
  My project name is Solar System. In this project, I have shown the sun and its planets are moving and rotating towards their own orbits. I have coloured, sized and positions the planets separately.
